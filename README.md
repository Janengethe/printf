## C - printf
> This is a group project with two memmbers workng on it. We are creating a mini-version of the normal "printf" function found in the <stdio.h> Library. The version that we will create will work the same way as the normal "printf", in that it will allow us to print any argument given to the standard output, that will include printing any combination of strings, integers, characters, among other different datatypes.
